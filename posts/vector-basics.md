# What Is a Vector — Really?

Most students are told that a **vector** is “an arrow.”  
But what does that really mean? Let’s break it down.

---

## 1. Intuition First

Think of a vector as **a set of instructions**.  

For example:  
- “Walk 3 steps forward, 2 steps right”  
- “Push a box with 5 N of force to the east”

> **Key point:** A vector **tells you direction and how much**, not just a point on paper.

## 2. Visualizing Vectors

A vector can be drawn as an arrow:  
- **Length** → How much (magnitude)  
- **Direction** → Where it points

Example:  
- $\vec{v} = (3, 2)$  
  This means 3 units in x-direction, 2 units in y-direction.
